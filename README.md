# ML-Classification-implementation

# 🧠 Classification Model Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of various **classification algorithms** in Machine Learning. The goal is to compare their performance on a given dataset by monitoring accuracy and other key metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## 🔍 Models Implemented

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naïve Bayes
* kernel SVM

## 📊 Model Evaluation

* Metrics: Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix visualization for comparison
* Accuracy monitored at the end for each model

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muneebbaig90/ML-Classification-implementation.git
   cd project-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # dont forget to specify dependencies before above cmd if you re using anything other than google collab
   ```
3. Run the notebook/script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📈 Results

Do you also want me to generate a **requirements.txt** (with the typical libraries you used for classification models) so your repo looks complete?
